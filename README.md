This section includes the calculation of the zero coupon bonds and coupon bonds.

The theory behind these calculations include that we start of with the principle value (1000) and coupon rate which is chosen to be 10% of the principle value (100)
From these values we can calculate the present value of coupon rate and principle value. When combined these give the present value of the bond itself. 
The final bodn value of 1167 represents that the investors are willing to pay upto 1167 present value with the following coupon bonds in the following year1 - 100, year2 - 100, year 3-100+principal amount

I have used OOP to make the calculations more systametic and dynamic.

I could have used a for loop when it comes to calculating the coupon bonds but rather used a bit more complex formulae to account for this.
